{"name":"Rfc2html","tagline":"Rfc2html in php","body":"# rfc2html\r\n\r\nOriginal idea and code from : [sf.net project](http://sourceforge.net/projects/rfc2html-php)\r\n\r\n# Installation and configuration\r\n\r\n## Setup of Cron\r\n\r\n* First you need to configure the update-rfc.sh script and then add in crontab.\r\n    + DATADIR - Directory where you would like your rfc's to be downloaded. Ideally this should be directory under your document root, so you can browse this.\r\n    + MAILTO - Email address (your's preferably :smile: ) , so you get a mail when the cron is completed with results.\r\n    + Add this script in cron for once a month or so with :\r\n\r\n         ```bash\r\n         * * 1 * * <path>/update-rfc.sh |/usr/sbin/sendmail -t\r\n         ```\r\n\r\n## Setup of script\r\n\r\n* Next, you need to download the jQuery datatables to the current folder along with the jquery js, with following commands:\r\n    ```bash\r\n    wget http://cdn.datatables.net/plug-ins/1.10.7/integration/jqueryui/dataTables.jqueryui.css\r\n    wget //cdn.datatables.net/plug-ins/1.10.7/integration/jqueryui/dataTables.jqueryui.js\r\n    wget http://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.4.min.js\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n* Now add the jquery js in index.php file.\r\n* :alien: Dont forget to change the ```rfile``` , ```./rfc2html/rfc2html.xslt``` paths in the index.php file and \r\n* :star2: RFCPATH in rfc2html.php file.\r\n\r\nNow you are all set to browse your rfc collection and viewer.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease visit [my blog](http://blog.amit-agarwal.co.in \"Amit Agarwals blog\")\r\n\r\nCheck out your changes in [markdown online](http://dillinger.io/)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
